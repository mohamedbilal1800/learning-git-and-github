An index is a composite statistic that aggregates multiple indicators.
It is a measure of changes in a representative group of individual data
points. The Federal Reserve created an official index (DXY) in 1973 to keep
track of the dollar’s value. Tracking the dollar’s value relative to 
certain foreign currencies started in 1971, however, after President Nixon 
abandoned the gold standard, which allowed the value of the dollar to 
float freely in the world’s foreign exchange markets.
